# wiki scripts

A these scripts were created for the contributors of https://wiki.gentoo.org, but they should work well across all [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) instances.

Wiki contributors needed a way to quickly take the output from common Linux commands and make it easy to copy/paste to articles on the wiki. This repository contains those scripts.
